# Four-Square Cipher

**6TEAM: Sean Zhan and Nickolaos (Nicko) Hatzigeorgiou**

This project is an informative presentation on how the Four-Square cipher works. It provides our own take on an Encryption and Decrytion method for this specific cipher along with a TryHackMe room with practice. We hope that through the in-person presentation and the reinforcement of what we teach in the TryHackMe room that everyone can understand this interesting cipher technique. Our presentation can be found in our `PRESENTATION.md` file

**How to Use:**

1- Git clone our repo

2- Run encrypt.py/decrypt.py. You can run encrypt.py by using the command `make encrypt` and you can run decrypt.py by using the command `make decrypt`

3- Input whether you want to use txt files or to directly use the keyboard in terminal

4- Input your message and keys. Our code features a key generator, so if you enter a key that is less than 25 unique letters, our code will fill in the rest of the letters to complete the key!

5- Your encoded/decoded message will be printed along with the placement of the key squares.
