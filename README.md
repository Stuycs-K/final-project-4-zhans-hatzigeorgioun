# Four-Square Cipher

**4SQUARED: Sean Zhan and Nickolaos (Nicko) Hatzigeorgiou**

This project is an informative presentation on how the Four-Square cipher works. It provides our own takes on an Encryption and Decrytion method for this specific cipher along with a TryHackMe room with further information along with practice. We hope that through the in-person presentation and the reinforcement of what we teach in the TryHackMe room that everyone can understand this interesting cipher technique.
