# Four-Square Cipher Presentation Plan

The plan is to explain how the Cipher works. We can compare the cipher to other ciphers we have done such as the Playfaire Cipher. We will demonstrate encoding a message with a key and decoding that message with the key. We can try to bruteforce a decoded message without a key. For this, maybe encode Alice.txt and attempt to get the decoded version of Alice.txt as well as the key that was used to encode it.
