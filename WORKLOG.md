# Work Log

## Nicko

### date 5/17

Wrote out description and did some research about the cipher. Will start the actual code tomorrow

### date 5/18

watched video on the visualization of the cipher

### date 5/19

did the splitting for the encrypt method

## Sean

### May 17, 2023

Worked on setting up the repo, outlining presentation and homework plans. Next step is to research the cipher

### May 18, 2023

Did some research on the cipher

### May 19, 2023

Continue research, looked into case where messages contain an odd number of characters since the cipher pairs up characters before encrypting
